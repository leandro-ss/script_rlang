## R Markdown

*This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.*

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readr,include=FALSE}

pokemon <- read_csv("dataset/pokemon.csv")
colnames(pokemon)[1] <- "No"
colnames(pokemon)[3] <- "Type1"
colnames(pokemon)[4] <- "Type2"
colnames(pokemon)[8] <- "SpAtk"
colnames(pokemon)[9] <- "SpDef"
head(pokemon)

names(pokemon) <- tolower(names(pokemon))
pokemon$generation <- factor(pokemon$generation, levels = c(6,5,4,3,2,1))
pokemon <- pokemon[pokemon$generation == 1 || pokemon$generation == 2 ]
pokemon
```

## Including Plots

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(pokemon)
```
*Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.*

We use the `aes` attribute to provide mappings for aesthetics. Note, this is required for all ggplot graphs.
```{r}
pokemon %>% ggplot(aes(x= type1, fill = generation)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()
```
